Assignment3Readme:

To run the code, you just need to put the proper folder into your workspace for the file:
Assignment3 should be put in your Netbeans workspace folder. THIS IS IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT THE FLAGS TO WORK PROPERLY.

Then, extract the folders in the workspace, open them using the correct program (Netbeans for HelloWorldJavaFX and Android Studio for HelloWorldAndroid) and run the project as would normally run any other project.

YOUR FOLDER SHOULD READ:

MyNetBeansWorkSpaceFolder/Assignment3,
where MyNetBeansWorkSpaceFolder is obviously the name of your netbeans workspace folder. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE FLAGS TO SHOW UP PROPERLY AND WILL NOT WORK OTHERWISE!!!

Note that sadly, as I don't know exactly what to hand in, I have just handed the entire project folder (as I would assume I should do), and android projects are (for some reason) much bigger than JavaFX files.

Another note: There are a couple bugs, Ie: when filtering the by value and being on a flag IN that continent value, IT WILL cause a bunch of UI logs about changing the flag to show up. Since I have to/do call add/remove in my filtering functionality, and changed() listener calls getFlagsChanged(), this is unavoidable (as far as I can tell), and I'm sorry for this.

As well, while I'm pretty proud of the resizing and the look (it resizes nearly perfectly for including maximization), It's not PERFECT, ie: the UILOG textbox is way too small, some parts of the widgets like the save button and flag 'bleed in' to other parts of the program. I tried to get this to look and work better, but after working on it nearly 3-5 days without getting it perfect, I've just given up. If you have time, marker (you probably don't though), can you tell me how I would fix this? I'd really like to know for the future!


I hope my program is to your liking and to the spec as best as possible; i've slaved over this a good number of hours to get it as perfect as possible, and greatly apologize for the errors it has as it is.
